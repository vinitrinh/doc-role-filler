We have continued to identify additional activity that we believe is being conducted by this network, including the leveraging of personas on additional social media platforms to promote political narratives. The personas have promoted narratives, specific to their regions of focus, that reflect UAE political interests. For example, we observed accounts posing as individuals from Turkey promote messaging critical of the Turkish Justice and Development (AKP) party and supportive of Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, the then-opposition candidate for Istanbul mayor, ahead of the Istanbul mayoral elections that occurred on June 23.",

This study also showed that 26% of users who were shown a data breach notification, changed their password.\n",
